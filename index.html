      <p>
        I'm a software engineer turned entrepreneur, best known as the founder of Sifflet, the leading data observability platform helping enterprises trust and act on their data. I designed and developed the first production-ready version and built an exceptional engineering team to scale it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to Sifflet, I launched Valuraise, a data consultancy that helped large organizations across banking, transportation, and media build modern data platforms and teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I advise and invest in French and European B2B SaaS startups, driven by a strong conviction that the next generation of enterprise software will be defined by the convergence of AI, data, and human-in-the-loop systems.
